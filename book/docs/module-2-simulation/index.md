# Module 2: The Digital Twin

*Master physics-based simulation for testing and developing humanoid robots*

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Explain why simulation is essential for robotics development
- Set up Gazebo Fortress for robot simulation
- Configure physics properties (gravity, collisions, constraints)
- Simulate sensors including LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs
- Understand Unity's role in high-fidelity rendering
- Load and visualize URDF models in Gazebo

## Prerequisites

- **Module 1 Completion**: Understanding of ROS 2 nodes, topics, and URDF format
- **System Requirements**: Ubuntu 22.04 with ROS 2 Humble installed
- **Hardware**: OpenGL 4.x compatible graphics
