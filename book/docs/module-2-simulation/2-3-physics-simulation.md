*Content placeholder - This chapter covers physics simulation in Gazebo*

## Overview

This chapter explains how Gazebo simulates physics including gravity, collisions, and joint constraints.

## Topics Covered

- Physics engine options (DART, Bullet, ODE)
- Gravity configuration
- Collision detection and response
- Joint types and constraints
- Friction and contact properties
- Real-time factor and step size
